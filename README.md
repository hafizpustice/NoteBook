## Introduction

All Eloquent methods that return more than one model result will return instances of the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection` class, including results retrieved via the `get` method or accessed via a relationship. The Eloquent collection object extends Laravel's [base collection](/docs/{{version}}/collections), so it naturally inherits dozens of methods used to fluently work with the underlying array of Eloquent models. Be sure to review the Laravel collection documentation to learn all about these helpful methods!

All collections also serve as iterators, allowing you to loop over them as if they were simple PHP arrays:

    use App\Models\User;

    $users = User::where('active', 1)->get();

    foreach ($users as $user) {
        echo $user->name;
    }

### **Composer**
Similarly, for composer we can use composer.sh to run composer commands. For example

    ./composer.sh install
